i didn't get it to look good with:

-vf "rotate=3*PI/180, crop=iw-2*abs(iw*sin(3*PI/180)), scale=iw:ih, pad=ceil(iw/2)*2:ceil(ih/2)*2:(ceil(iw/2)*2-iw)/2:(ceil(ih/2)*2-ih)/2"

(had still black borders)



here is the download of original video and its variant 5 (rotated 3 degrees, ignore brightness etc)
to compare how i like it to look like.

i have the variants from an third party software and trying to build our own now with you.
